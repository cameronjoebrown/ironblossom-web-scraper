# Iron Blossom Web Scraper
A web scraper of the Iron Blossom Lodge Timeshares for Sale website [see it here](https://www.ironblosam.net/for_sale_by_owner.php) that notifies when a new unit is posted for sale.

## Problem I'm Trying To Solve
The Iron Blossom Lodge has a website for timeshare owners to post timeshares they are trying to sell. Unfortunately, the site provides no way to get notified when new timeshares are posted. This means you could miss out on potential units you may be interested in buying if you don't check the site frequently enough. I want to create a way to be notified when a new timeshare is posted for sale so I don't miss out on any new postings. I'd especially like it if I could get notified only for new postings on the weeks I choose.

## Requirements
1. Ability to set the specific weeks I care about
2. Notify when a new unit is posted for those specific weeks (probably notify through text, but email would be fine too)
